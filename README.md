# Motivation

My passion to become a developer/architect insprired me to take IOT course in the master's program. I couldn't regret my decision so far as I get to do new and innovative tasks everyday. Once such task is entering into the world of GitHub. I didn't get a chance to work with repositories in GitHub in my previous role as IT Analyst. We used ChangeMan ZMF for all our project releases. It's a quite different experience in GitHub compared to ChangeMan. I find it very feasible as we an use GitHub directly in our web browser.

I'm really excited to create a repository in GitHub and welcome seamless collaboration with the professor and other students.
