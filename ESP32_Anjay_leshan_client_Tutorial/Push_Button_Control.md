## ESP32 Anjay leshan client experiments - Push Button control

In this Tutorial, we will see how we can record the push button activites in Leshan server. The button is a basic component and widely used in many ESP32 projects. In the code, by reading the state of the input pin, we can infer the button is pressed or not.

**How Button Works**
- When the button is pressed, the pin A is connected to the pin B
- When the button is NOT pressed, the pin A is NOT connected to the pin B

### Components:

- Push Button
- Raspberry Pi
- ESP32
- 2 220 Ohm pull up resistor
- Breadboard
- 2 Jumper wires
